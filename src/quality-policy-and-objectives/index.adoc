=== Quality Policy

// Describe what your company is about, specifically, its mission and things
// which are important for it. Maybe you’re developing software for patients
// with a certain disease and your goal is to improve their lives.

// In addition, the policy should include a commitment to meet legal requirements,
// keep the QMS up to date and define quality objectives to work towards.

=== Quality Objectives

// Whatever policy you outlined above, now you need to make it measurable
// by defining objectives which can be tracked. Those objectives should not
// (only) refer to the quality of your devices but the quality of your QMS
// and the overall work of your organization. Typical examples are: hiring
// excellence in staff, providing, best-of-class device performance, high
// standards of customer satisfaction, etc.

Orientation on standards for medical devices.

Follow best practices for Java projects and open source communities.

Agility. It would be nice to create something useful for society. Adapt according to user feedback.

=== Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

// Auditors might ask you: how do you keep track of a quality objective, to
// see if it was achieved or not? The answer is: Key Performance
// Indicators. As part of your management review, you have to review all
// QMS processes plus your quality policy and objectives at least annually.
// Now, you can meet both requirements at the same time by defining KPIs
// for your QMS processes. You can then argue that by achieving your KPIs,
// you make sure that your processes run well, which also meets your
// quality objectives.

// These are your action items: 1. Make sure to define at least one KPI for
// each QMS process. 2. Make sure each quality objectives translates into
// at minimum one process KPI. Where there’s no corresponding process for a
// quality objective, you define additional KPIs that are not
// process-related. 3. You can document those KPIs either in each SOP or in
// a separate overview sheet. For example, you can use the template for a
// management review report for that purpose.

// Also see regulatory requirements: ISO 13485, para. 4.1.3.a (process
// KPIs) and para. 5.6.2 (management review input).

// In this section here, describe where you define your KPIs and how you
// keep track of them. For example, say that you define KPIs in every
// single SOP or reference to a separate, central overview sheet. Ideally,
// KPIs are tracked by each process owner independently.
