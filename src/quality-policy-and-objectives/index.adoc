=== Quality Policy

// Describe what your company is about, specifically, its mission and things
// which are important for it. Maybe you’re developing software for patients
// with a certain disease and your goal is to improve their lives.

// In addition, the policy should include a commitment to meet legal requirements,
// keep the QMS up to date and define quality objectives to work towards.

The goal of this project is to facilitate the implementation of openEHR for healthcare-related information systems.

=== Up-to-dateness

➡️ Given an openEHR specification is supported, when a new version is released, then a new openEHR4j package is released within 30 days.

=== Follow best practices

➡️ The general open source best practice compliance will be measured with a badge from the https://www.bestpractices.dev[OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program]. 

➡️ The code style will be checked with the default configuration of https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud[SonarCloud] and by using the https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[Google Java code style], validated with https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/google_style.html[Checkstyle].

➡️ Applying "state-of-the-art" practices might also be regarded as compliance with the standards that apply to medical devices.

=== Zero defects

➡️ A search on https://github.com[GitHub]footnote:[The service provider for the source code of openehr4j] with the query `org:openehr4j label:bug` should yield 0 results in the "Issues" tab: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aopenehr4j+label%3Abug&type=issues[github.com].

➡️ The code generator projectfootnote:[https://github.com/openehr4j/api-generator] should have a test coverage badge with a score of 90% or more.

// === Quality Objectives

// Whatever policy you outlined above, now you need to make it measurable
// by defining objectives which can be tracked. Those objectives should not
// (only) refer to the quality of your devices but the quality of your QMS
// and the overall work of your organization. Typical examples are: hiring
// excellence in staff, providing, best-of-class device performance, high
// standards of customer satisfaction, etc.

// === Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

// Auditors might ask you: how do you keep track of a quality objective, to
// see if it was achieved or not? The answer is: Key Performance
// Indicators. As part of your management review, you have to review all
// QMS processes plus your quality policy and objectives at least annually.
// Now, you can meet both requirements at the same time by defining KPIs
// for your QMS processes. You can then argue that by achieving your KPIs,
// you make sure that your processes run well, which also meets your
// quality objectives.

// These are your action items: 1. Make sure to define at least one KPI for
// each QMS process. 2. Make sure each quality objectives translates into
// at minimum one process KPI. Where there’s no corresponding process for a
// quality objective, you define additional KPIs that are not
// process-related. 3. You can document those KPIs either in each SOP or in
// a separate overview sheet. For example, you can use the template for a
// management review report for that purpose.

// Also see regulatory requirements: ISO 13485, para. 4.1.3.a (process
// KPIs) and para. 5.6.2 (management review input).

// In this section here, describe where you define your KPIs and how you
// keep track of them. For example, say that you define KPIs in every
// single SOP or reference to a separate, central overview sheet. Ideally,
// KPIs are tracked by each process owner independently.
