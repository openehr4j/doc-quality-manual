=== Relation to openEHR/java-libs

The GitHub project https://github.com/openEHR/java-libs[openEHR/java-libs] project is an attempt to provide a reference implementation for openEHR in the Java programming languagefootnote:[see https://www.openehr.org/publications/health_ict/R-Chen-etal-openEHR-Java-Impl-Medinfo2007-2007-03-31.pdf[Chen, Rong & Klein, Gunnar. (2007). The openEHR Java reference implementation project. Studies in health technology and informatics. 129. 58-62. 10.3233/978-1-58603-774-1-58.]]. In contract to this project, openEHR4J does not provide an implementation of openEHR, but aims at just transpiling the specifications themselves into the Java programming language.

So, users of https://github.com/openEHR/java-libs[openEHR/java-libs] may use it as SDK in the application that they are creating. Users of openEHR4J would be authors of SDKs.
